Just for personal website.

## debug
**Problem 1:** 4 days ago's commit came out fail, so the new files were updated on github, but website didn't show the new page.

**Solution 1:** So I check the *Actions*, and rebuild it. Then it works.

**Problem 2:** One day the website just weirdly threw out 404.

**Solution 2:**  Change anything and git push again, the 404 disappears.
